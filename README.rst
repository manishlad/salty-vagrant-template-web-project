========================
Template website project
========================

This is a basic template web project with a development environment created
in a _`salty-vagrant` virtual machine and provisioned by _`Saltstack` scripts.
The guest virtual development environment shares the src folder from the host
and serves the website mapped to port 8080 on the host.
